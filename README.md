#NBSoundCloudActivity

NBSoundCloudActivity is a simple subclass of UIActivity that allows you to post audio content to SoundCloud via the UIActivityViewController introduced in iOS 6. It wraps the SoundCloud sharing SDK to display a posting user interface and to actually send the data.

#Installation
First, clone or download the Git repository to your local disk.

The sample project uses [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org) to manage dependencies, so you'll need to install it and run the following command within the project root directory to get the dependent code

	pod install

Now you're ready to open the sample project and run it. Once you're satisfied, you can copy the code in "Source" into your own project. Keep in mind you'll also need the SoundCloud SDK dependencies in your own project as well.
